# Schedule-Compiler

This was a project I completed in my freshman year of college as my final project for my basic programming course. I created this for a school club that I was president of at the time.

The program itself is very simple and consists mainly of two python files. To run the program, simply clone the files and run them using python gg_schedule_matcher.py. The program will ask you for some input. Once the program completes, run the other files using python gg_schedule_aligner.py.

Looking back on this project, I can tell that I was a beginner-level coder. Several things could be optimized and I could have used a variety of packages to streamline some of the time comparisons. Regardless, I'm glad that I completed this as it has served as a foundation for all my future programming endeavors.
